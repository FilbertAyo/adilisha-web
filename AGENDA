  ADILISHA AGENDA 2049: STEM Clubs and Labs in Every Tanzanian School
  
  Vision:
Empowering a generation of young Tanzanians—especially girls—through access to STEM education and leadership opportunities. By 2049, we aim to establish STEM clubs and labs in all 3,904 government secondary schools across Tanzania, transforming the future workforce and addressing pressing global challenges like poverty, gender inequality, and technological advancement.
Goal: Equip all government secondary schools with fully functioning STEM clubs by 2030 and STEM labs by 2049.
Focus Areas:Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) with an emphasis on girls' participation.
 
    Why STEM? The Case for Action in Tanzania
 
   CURRENT SITUATION:
Gender Gap: Only 25% of Tanzanian students pursuing STEM fields are girls.
Rural Disadvantage: Rural schools lack resources for science and technology education, exacerbating inequality.
Future Workforce: Tanzania needs a STEM-literate workforce to participate in the digital economy and compete globally.
OUR OPPORTUNITY:
- Building STEM clubs and labs will foster problem-solving skills, creativity, and innovation in students, giving them the tools to contribute to national development and global challenges.
Investment in STEM education will uplift entire communities by preparing youth for careers in high-demand fields.
